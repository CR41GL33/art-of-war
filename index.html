    <p>After playing some of the most engaging online games available an old friend and I wished we could play this type of gaming for real as opposed to the digital online systems that we are all used to. 
        Well I am very pleased to say that we developed a system that will allow us to do just that incorporating a 6 a side format which allows sports fans and sofa jockeys to play head to head using some of the best and most user friendly technology available in the uk. 
        This is not paintball or airsoft(so u wont get bruised) you must have a strategy in order for your team to win because no lone wolf ever won the war,
         This is close quarter battle in a purpose built arena with 3 squads of 6 players in rotating engagements fighting it out in objective based games. </p></body>
