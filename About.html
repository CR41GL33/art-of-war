<h1 class="header">WELCOME TO ARTofWAR Lasertag</h1>

<div class="body-text">
After playing some of the most engaging online games available a friend and I wished we could play this type of gaming for real as opposed to the digital online systems that we are all used to.<br/>
   <br/>
Well I am very pleased to say that we developed a system that will allow us to do just that incorporating a 6-a side format which allows sports fans and online gamers to play head to head using some of the best and most user friendly technology available in Europe.<br/>
    <br/>
This is not paintball or airsoft (so you won't get bruised).<br/>
<br/>
     You must have a strategy in order for your team to win because<br/>
      "no lone wolf ever won the war".<br/>
      <br/>
     This is close quarter battle in a purpose built arena with 3 squads of 6 players in rotating engagements fighting it out in objective based games.
