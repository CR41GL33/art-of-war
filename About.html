<h1 class="header">WELCOME TO ARTofWAR Lasertag</h1>

<div class="body-text">
After playing some of the most engaging online games available an old friend and I wished we could play this type of gaming for real as opposed to the digital online systems that we are all used to.<br/>
    Well I am very pleased to say that we developed a system that will allow us to do just that incorporating a 6 a side format which allows sports fans and sofa jockeys to play head to head using some of the best and most user friendly technology available in Europe.<br/>
    This is not paintball or airsoft(so u wont get bruised) you must have a strategy in order for your team to win because "no lone wolf ever won the war",
     This is close quarter battle in a purpose built arena with 3 squads of 6 players in rotating engagements fighting it out in objective based games.
